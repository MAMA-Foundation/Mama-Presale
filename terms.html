        <h1>Terms of Use MAMA Token Presale</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: August 4, 2025</p>
        <p>
            Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully before participating in the $MAMA token presale or using any services offered via our website. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not access or use the services.
        </p>
        <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>
            The $MAMA token is a Solana-based digital asset designed for community engagement, cultural narrative, and experimental utility. It is not a security, equity, or investment vehicle. Participation in the presale is entirely voluntary and without expectation of profit.
        </p>
        <h2>ELIGIBILITY</h2>
        <p>
            You must be at least 18 years of age to participate. You are prohibited from using our services if you reside in or are a citizen of jurisdictions where participation is restricted or prohibited by law, including but not limited to the United States, North Korea, Iran, and sanctioned territories. By using the service, you represent that you meet these requirements.
        </p>
        <h2>TOKEN SALE & REFERRAL PROGRAM</h2>
        <p>
            You may exchange SOL (Solana) for $MAMA tokens at the published presale rate. Each purchase is final and non-refundable.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you use a referral code, or share one, you may be eligible to earn a reward denominated in $MAMA or equivalent. The referral system tracks wallet addresses, referrer code, and transaction metadata (such as signature and amount) solely for the purpose of reward eligibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Referrers are ranked and rewarded based on the total amount of SOL referred. Payouts, if any, will be made after the presale concludes, subject to eligibility verification and available pool size.
        </p>
        <h2>NO WARRANTIES / NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE</h2>
        <p>
            All services are provided "as is" without any warranty. We make no guarantees of any kind, including the future value, utility, or success of $MAMA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nothing on this site or in our communications constitutes investment advice, legal advice, or a solicitation. Always consult with a licensed professional.
        </p>
        <h2>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
        <p>
            All rights, title, and interest in the MAMA brand, logo, visuals, smart contracts, user interface, and underlying code belong to the creators or their respective licensors. Unauthorized use is prohibited.
        </p>
        <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>
            You assume all risk when interacting with the presale smart contract or our platform. We are not liable for any loss of funds, wallet errors, gas fees, missed rewards, network congestion, bugs, or security issues.
        </p>
        <h2>GOVERNING LAW</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
        </p>
        <h2>MODIFICATIONS</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time. Updates will be posted on this page with a new "Last Updated" date. Continued use of our services after changes constitutes acceptance.
